    <h1>VACATION TO CANADA</h1>
    <p>Travelling for me is really something that …you know, discovering new regions , new countries new, grounds  it’s, for me , something that is just incredible ,  and then I’m lucky that I can do that so I enjoy it thoroughly. And to be here at Canada today , it’s really something that I dreamt about all my life . And then the region of whistler , we talk about it everywhere in Europe , It’s like a bit of a dream for every european to go there once . And then today , to be here and to be able to sky a little bit here  . And to be able to ski ligns of pilot . And there is an incredible snow , so it’s something crazy . I’m really happy to be here in this trip , it’s been two days since we’ve been here , we found some really really good conditions. </p>
